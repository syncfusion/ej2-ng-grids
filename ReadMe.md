# Grid Overview

The Grid control is used to display and manipulate tabular data with configuration options to control the way the data is presented and manipulated.
It will pull data from a data source, such as array of JSON objects, `OData web services`, or [`DataManager`](http://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/data/api-dataManager.html) binding data fields to columns.
Also displaying a column header to identify the field with support for grouped records.

The most important features available in the Grid components are paging, sorting, filtering, searching and grouping.
